It's good to be back! Here's another chat app but with a twist

This time it's mobile friendly-ish

v1: find random chatters to start talking with. Pairing "algorithm" is first come first serve

v2: dm/private chat room functionality now available

v3 (coming soon??): cleaner UI?? random pairing based on geo distance?? Games like tic tac toe/ rock paper scissors or air hockey?? Let me know if you have ideas!

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Allow location services in your browser. Data is not stored anywhere so pls don't freak. This data is for a feature to yet be implemented.

2. Set a username if you feel like it. By default it will be set to your user ID (randomly generated everytime you load or refresh the page)

Button Explanations >>>>>>

Find Random Chatter: Pair with someone else looking for a chat partner. You will be able to see each other's usernames when connected

Create Private Room: This will create a private room and copy a link to your clipboard for someone to join that room. All they have to do is click the link and they will enter the room automatically.

Clear Textbox: This will simply erase your outgoing message. No data is tacked or saved on this app so once you clear it, it's gone from all memory except your chat partner's.



HAVE FUN
