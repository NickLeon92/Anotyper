It's good to be back! Here's another chat app but with a twist

This time it's mobile friendly-ish

v2: find random chatters to start talking with. Pairing "algorithm" is first come first serve

v3 (coming soon): dm functionality where you can connect to specific users to chat

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Allow location services in your browser. Data is not stored anywhere so pls don't freak. This data is for a feature to yet be implemented.

2. Set a username if you feel like it. By default it will be set to your user ID (randomly generated everytime you load or refresh the page)

3. Click "find random chatter" and you will be paired with the next available chatter

Bugs: you probably will encounter accidentally entering chat room with your previous user ID if you simply refresh and join again. Just make sure someone is on the other side waiting maybe lol

HAVE FUN
